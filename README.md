### Core Problem

* Organizations follows CI and CD processes that differ across teams
* Manual interventions are involved making deployment error prone
* Multiple versions/releases of a product runs at different stages, such as development, e2e testing, acceptance testing, staging, client-side deployment, production
* Manual interventions do not reflect the latest state a product is in to other stakeholders
* Consolidating current state of a product running at different stages in diverged geographical location is cumbersome when done manually

#### Solution

* A web-based deployment dashboard that provides:
* A continuous  delivery platform
* A consolidated view of the different stages a product is currently in.

#### Application

* Devops/operations team follow a standard fully automated deployment process
* Management uses the deployment dashboard  to make business predictions and decisions  based on current state of different products of the organization
* Technical teams track the states of a product and plan delivery
* On site teams track the states of a product and plan client-side testing and deployment to production
* Clients have a single view to track progress of their products
